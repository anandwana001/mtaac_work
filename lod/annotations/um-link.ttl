# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE
# All pieces of information should have the form of a triple, i.e., a relation
# SOME_SUBJECT SOME_PROPERTY SOME_OBJECT .
# Every triple should be ended with a "."
# See below for examples for triples and naming conventions. Here, we map from ETSCRI categories to Unimorph categories.
# Validate the resulting file using http://ttl.summerofcode.be/
# After "#", you can write additional comments, everything else must be well-formed

# If successfully modelled, you can open the mapping file in Protégé (http://protege.stanford.edu/)
# This allows for browsing and searching in both ETSCRI and Unimorph ontologies and formally representing the linking

# browse the Unimorph documentation under http://www.acoli.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/resources/olia/owl/experimental/unimorph/html/ and https://unimorph.github.io/doc/unimorph-schema.pdf

### example for an exact mapping
etscri:ABL owl:sameAs unimorph:ABL .

# other mapping relations:
# for approximate mapping, use skos:closeMatch 
# if the Unimorph term is broader, use skos:broader
# if the ETSCRI term is broader, use skos:narrower
# if no exact linking can be established, but some overlap exists, use rdfs:seeAlso

### example for partial mapping
etscri:L1 skos:broader unimorph:IN.
etscri:L1 skos:broader unimorph:ESS. 
# we cannot formally express the + operation, but in this way, we can say that it is in the intersection of both

### add an explanative comment to the ETSCRI tag (optional, but recommended)
etscri:L1 rdfs:comment "locative1 case-marker (df) mapped to IN+ESS (Inessive).
\"UD has Case=Loc, which is used in a number of Indo-European languages (especially Slavic) but also in Basque, Turkish and others. It has mostly a locative meaning, where the placement and direction are not precisely specified. It can also have a non-locative meaning. The closest counterpart of the locative case in UniMorph is plain ESS\" (http://universaldependencies.org/v2/features.html#unimorph-dimensions-draft-v2). But the possibility for more refinement remains; see Sylak-Glassman 2016 p. 7 on combining simple features."@en .
# Here, the object is a string. @en at the end means it is in English.
# Note: In a String, do not use ", but rather \".

### if necessary, state that there is a problem (optional)
etscri:L1 owl:versionInfo "TODO: ..." .
