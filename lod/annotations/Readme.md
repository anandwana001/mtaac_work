CDLI Annotation Linking
=

* Model CDLI annotations as ontologies
	* DONE: ETSCRI model available under http://purl.org/olia/owl/experimental/sumerian/etscri.owl
* Identify other terminology repositories to link to
	* For the moment, Unimorph: http://purl.org/olia/owl/experimental/sumerian/etscri.owl
	* Later, Universal Dependency Features (t.b.a.)
* Define a mapping between ETSCRI and Unimorph (resp., UD features, later on)
	* DONE: Informal and preliminary mapping by Lucas Reckling, see internal MTAAC Google drive and email from Sep 8, 2017
	* TODO: Formalize mapping and comments about the mapping in RDF/Turtle
	 * See examples/instructions under um-link.ttl (this directory)
	* Later, Universal Dependency Features (t.b.a.)
* Link morphological annotations 
	* TODO: Using SPARQL update for ETSCRI
