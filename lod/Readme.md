Towards a Linked Open Data edition of Sumerian corpus data
==

 - edit sample data from CDLI-related language resources to develop format specifications
 - given a sample of an annotated corpus provided a CoNLL (TSV) format
     1. convert via CoNLL-RDF (illustrated for an ETSCRI data sample)
     2. link with dictionary (illustrated for the ePSD)
     3. link annotations to repositories of annotation terminology (here, the Universal Dependencies or UniMorph)
     4. link with CDLI metadata (e.g., http://triplestore.modyco.fr -- availability of that data needs to be confirmed)
 
 -  apply these specifications to provide a LLOD view on CDLI content, e.g., using http://www.rdb2rdf.org
